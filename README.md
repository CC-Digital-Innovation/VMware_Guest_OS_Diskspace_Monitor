## Requirements

- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
- [VMware.PowerCLI](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VMware.PowerCLI)
- [PsIni](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PsIni/3.1.2)
- [PSWriteHTML](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWriteHTML)
- [Posh-Syslog](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Posh-SYSLOG)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
- [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/download)

## Installation

- Download code from GitHub
    - _Note:  If you don't have Git installed you can also just grab the zip:  https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/vmware_guest_diskspace_mon/archive/master.zip_

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CC-Digital-Innovation/vmware_guest_diskspace_mon.git
    ```

- Copy config.ini.example to config.ini
- Update settings in config.ini file.

## Usage

- Install Requirements from Powershell command prompt

    ```Powershell
    Start-Process Powershell -Verb RunAs
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Confirm:$false Unrestricted -Force
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    Install-Module -Confirm:$false -Name PsIni
    .\requirements.ps1
    ```

- From Powershell command prompt

    ```Powershell
    .\check_diskspace.ps1
    ```

- Install as Windows service using nssm_helper.ps1

    _Note: Be sure to update the NSSM sevicename and scriptpath in the config.ini_

    ```Powershell
    .\nssm_helper.ps1
    ```
    _Note:  You will need to update the service to run as a user with admin privledge._


- From Windows command prompt or from task scheduler

    _Note: Running as a service is preferred, if you want to run as a scheduled task, you will need to modify the code to remove the while loop. I may update this to happen automatically in a future release depending on a config.ini setting._
    ```Powershell
    start powershell "& "./check_diskspace.ps1"
    ```



## Compatibility

This is was built and tested on Windows 10 with Powershell Version 5.1.19041.1023, but most likely work on any Windows system with Powershell >= Version 2.
